      <description>Consider the following contingency table for a retrospective study:
   \ Disease(Yes) Disease(No) Total     Treatment 1 a b a+b   Treatment 2 c d c+d    There are two statistics of interest:
  Relative Risk (RR): $\frac{a/(a+b)}{c/(c+b)}$
  Odds ratios (OR): $\frac{a/b}{c/d}$
  Relative risk is easy to understand: it&amp;rsquo;s the ratio of disease probability between two treatment groups.</description>

      <description>Shannon&amp;rsquo;s Entropy: $H(X) = -\sum_{x \in X} p(x) \log p(x) = E[-\log p(X)]$
(or $H(X) = -\int_{x \in X} p(x) \log p(x) dx$ )
An intuitive explaination: For independent observations $x, y$, their joint density is $p(x,y) = p(x)p(y)$.
Want to obtain their &amp;ldquo;information&amp;rdquo; $h(x)$ with the following property:
  Monotonic w.r.t. $p(x)$: the higher the density is , the more information we get
  Always positive
  Additivity: information gained from $(x,y)$ is the sum of information gained from $x$ and $y$, i.</description>

$(FP + TP)$ are denoted as &amp;ldquo;discoveries&amp;rdquo;, FDR is the expected rate of false outcomes in all discoveries.
How to Control FDR (the B-H procedure) Suppose a total of m tests are conducted. Rank them by p-values low to high, denote as $H_1, .</description>

      <description>Reminders about constructing blogs:
 To generate a new blog:  blogdown::new_post(title = &amp;#39;Post Title&amp;#39;, author = &amp;#39;Your Name&amp;#39;) To include an image, first put the image in a folder (here it&amp;rsquo;s named image) under directory content, and use the following code:  &amp;lt;img alt = &#39;&#39; height=&#39;400&#39; width=&#39;400&#39; src=&#39;/images/Pikachu.png&#39; /&amp;gt;
To include a link:  [Zhili&#39;s Website](http://zhiliqiao.github.io)
Zhili&amp;rsquo;s Website
To rebuild the site and show:  blogdown::build_site() + blogdown::serve_site()</description>

      <description>Below uses dataset mtcars as the dataset.
An R shiny app is constructed by 2 major parts, UI and SERVER: shinyApp(ui = UI, server = SERVER)
1. UI UI is how your dashboard appears to the user. It can include the following 3 options: UI = dashboardPage(header = Header, sidebar = Sidebar, body = Body)
  header:
Header = dashboardHeader(title = &amp;#39;My Title&amp;#39;, titleWidth = 10) Title of the dashboard page (topleft).</description>

      <description>My research focuses on studying specific characteristics of biological data:
Poisson hurdle model-based clustering for microbiome data (Submitted to Bioinformatics)
 We developed a Poisson hurdle model-based clustering method for count datasets to deal with its high sparsity.  Dirichlet Multinomial Biclustering for Compositional Microbiome Data  To mimic the sampling structure of microbiome datasets, we introduce a model-based biclustering method based on a Dirichlet Multinomial dstribution.  Bayesian Feature Selection and Causal Inference for Group Structured Data   In high-dimensional regression with subgroups of observations, we try to identify differentially expressed features by assigning a joint Lasso penalty.</description>
